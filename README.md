# 💳 Online Payment Fraud Detection Website

This project is a web-based application designed to detect fraudulent online payment transactions using machine learning techniques. It offers a user-friendly interface where users can input transaction details and receive real-time predictions about the legitimacy of the transaction.

## 🔍 Features

- 🔐 Fraud Detection using trained machine learning models
- 🌐 Web interface built with Streamlit
- 📊 Visualizations of transaction patterns
- 📁 Upload CSV files for bulk predictions
- 💡 Real-time feedback on model predictions

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

The model is trained on a dataset of online payment transactions. It uses various features such as transaction amount, location, time, and user history to detect fraudulent behavior.

### Techniques Used:
- Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
- Feature Selection
- Classification Algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Model Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
